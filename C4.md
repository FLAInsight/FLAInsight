#### Attack Process

(1) The liquidity pool is initially set up with 1000 units of token $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ and 100 units of token $T\_{\mathbb{G}}$, and the attacker starts with no assets.

(2) The attacker _borrows_ a large sum ($x$) of $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ from a flash loan service. 

(3) The attacker _deposits_ a premeditated amount ($9,990$) of $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ into the liquidity pool.

(4) The attacker requests to _withdraw_ the previously deposited $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ , causing the liquidity pool to pay an additional amount ($999$) of $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ at a certain deflation rate (10\%) and the amount of $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ reserved in the liquidity pool decreases sharply (1 $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ remains). After affecting the liquidity pool, the attacker deposits only 1 of $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$.

(5) Finally, the attacker can _exchange_ 50 of $T\_{\mathbb{G}}$.
In general, before the attack, the attacker must pay 1,100 (1,000 + 1,000 * 10\%) $T_{\mathbb{D}}$ to exchange for 50 $T\_{\mathbb{G}}$, while after the attack, the attacker only pays 1,000.1 $T\_{\mathbb{D}}$ to exchange for 50 $T\_{\mathbb{G}}$.
